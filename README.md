# ChatApp_Playground
A basic chat app to create a platform for members of an organization to communicate between themselves. This will later on be used as a platform for our own group, and if it really pulls off, we might just release it for fun. So, put in your ideas and your aspirations. And work towards it. Once We decide on the "preliminary tasks", I will put up issues, which will be tasks to implement in the program and you can pick them up and start working. I'll try and add some dummy code before everybody get's going, just to provide a basic platform to hack on.

## Preliminary Tasks:
 - Decide on a platform to use
 - Decide the basic features
 - Coordinate different tasks
 - Database to implement

## Instructions to Setup:
 - Fork the repository.
 - Clone the repository if not already cloned.
 - If the repo was already cloned, do a `git pull` or `git fetch` followed by `merge` ( Look at github guide for more information ).
 - Create a virtual environment with name `env`, otherwise you'll have to update `.gitignore`. If already have one ignore this step.
 - Activate the virtual environment by `source <name_of_virtualenvironment>/bin/activate`
 - Do `pip install requirements.txt`, this will install the requirements in your virtual environment folder. 
 - Now you have all requirements setup and you can code what you want.
 - Take a look at some tutorial or guide on how to work with a virtual environment and go ahead.
 - Make the changes you want to and update the `requirements.txt` file, with any new dependency.
 - Happy Coding after that

## Instructions to Contribute:
 - Do a pull request from your repository as of now. Will be accepted after review
 - Further instructions will follow as need
