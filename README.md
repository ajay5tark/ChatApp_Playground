# ChatApp_Playground
A basic chat app to create a platform for members of an organization to communicate between themselves. This will later on be used as a platform for our own group, and if it really pulls off, we might just release it for fun. So, put in your ideas and your aspirations. And work towards it. Once We decide on the "preliminary tasks", I will put up issues, which will be tasks to implement in the program and you can pick them up and start working. I'll try and add some dummy code before everybody get's going, just to provide a basic platform to hack on.

## Preliminary Tasks:
 - Decide on a platform to use
 - Decide the basic features
 - Coordinate different tasks
 - Database to implement
